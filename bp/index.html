              <li>Has a use case a description that can lead to a testable requirement? (discussed 25/2/2015, wording?) </li>

          <h3>Linking Data</h3>
          <p>linking between things at the dataset level is largely covered by DWBP. Put reference here. </p>
          <p>make the links within the dataset discoverable</p>
          <p>it's useful to have hyperlinks to things like Geonames, wikipedia, OSM etc (see list on the mailiing list, keyword: stamp collecting)</p>
          <p>making links between entities in the dataset discoverable and crawlable. Using linksets are one example of doing that at the dataset level, a third party making collections of links browsable and allowing discovery of backlinks.  Note that this is an emerging practice, not an established one.  Also address here: how do you deal with maintaining links over time (when resources you link to may change or disappear). Example: OpenPHACTS. </p>
          <p class="issue">This needs further discussion. Linksets does not seem to be an evidence-based best practice. It might be an emerging practice; CSIRO example. This might go in a shared note with the DWBP. </p>
          <p>how to publish your semantics if you're using XML / GML</p>
          <p>put reference here to LDBP: http://www.w3.org/TR/ld-bp/ Best Practices for Publishing Linked Data (includes info on publishing vocabularies)</p>
          <p>research paper on using PROV to distinguish between world views is at http://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13326-015-0008-2/fulltext.html</p>
          <p>about representations changing over time: administrative boundaries and catchment datasets as examples of how you shouldn't create new objects when for some reason the records change while the real world thing stays the same. Dataset owners need to be aware of this.</p>
          <p>(here or in a different section) A list/matrix of the common formats (GeoJSON, GML, RDF, JSON-LD) and what you can or can't achieve with it.</p>

        <section class="bp-identifiers">
          <h3>Assigning identifiers to real world things and information resources</h3>
          <p>Mostly, people looking for information are interested in real world things, not in information records. </p>
          <p>Real world things vs features: Lighthouse example goes here (insert whiteboard picture here); real world thing, feature is information record about the thing, but often in current practice has properties that are about the real thing and properties about the information record. The features are in a dataset, the dataset has an id and the features have a local id. So currently you cannot link to them; the features need to have http URI identifiers instead. </p>
          <p>Examples: CSIRO spatial identifier reference framework; http://almere.pilod.nl/bgtld/v2; ...</p>
          <p>tell people what to do if they've got feature data and publish that in a linked data way. First see if there's an authoritative URI already that you can link to and if so do that; else how to mint the identifier yourself based on the features in your dataset and how the identifier is for the real world thing the feature describes. Local names are not typically URIs. We know we want to use URIs as identifiers. So we might take the dataset URI - which identifies a silo
          ... think of a different dataset, this one about shiprecks near lighthouses. But problem is mapping the local IDs, we want to be able to express the linkages within the dataset
          </p>
          <p>add reference to DWBP BP 11 (once phila gets this addition approved by the wg).</p>
          
          <p>Using sameAs to establish that two resources are about the same thing. These sameAs statements could be collected into one set and this set could have provenance so that you can see who created the sameAs statements and decide if you'd trust them. </p>
          <p class="issue">this part could fit into the Linking data section instead of the identification section</p>
          <p>datasets need to be identified</p>
          <p>features (things) need to be identified</p>
          <p>representations (geometry, topology) should be identified and must be if they are managed elsewhere.</p>
          <p>Identifiers should be URLs (http URIs) and must be globally unique.</p>
          <p>in order for identifiers to be useful, people should be comfortable creating them themselves (bottom up, like hashtags) and this BP will give some pointers about how to create good URIs (should be dereferenceable/resolvable). There is no top down authority that you have to go to in order to create identifiers for spatial objects. So just make them up yourself if you need them and they don't exist.</p>

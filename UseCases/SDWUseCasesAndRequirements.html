      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The mission of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2015/spatial/">Spatial Data on the Web Working Group</a>, as described in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2015/spatial/charter">charter</a>, is to clarify and to formalize standards on spatial data on the web. In particular:
        <ol>
        <li>to determine how spatial information can best be integrated with other data on the Web;</li>
        <li>to determine how machines and people can discover that different facts in different datasets relate to the same place, especially when 'place' is expressed in different ways and at different levels of granularity;</li>
        <li>to identify and assess existing methods and tools and then create a set of best practices for their use;</li>
        <li>where desirable, to complete the standardization of informal technologies already in widespread use.</li>
        </ol>
        This document describes the results of the first steps of working towards these goals. Members of the working group and other stakeholders have come up with a number of use cases that describe how spatial data on the web could work. From these use cases, a number of requirements for further work are derived. In this document, use cases, requirements and their relationships are described. Requirements and use cases are also related to the deliverables of the working group, which are:

        <p>This is really one of several future, but realistic, meteorological scenarios to aim at.</p>
        <p>National Hydro-Meteorological Services around the world are coordinated via the WMO (World Meteorological Organisation), part of the the United Nations system. WMO has the same status as ISO, and its standards and regulatory materials applies to all its 193 national meteorological services and are available in the six working languages ( عربي | 中文 | Fr | Ru | Es | En). WMO has embarked on a long-term (think a decade or so) programme to update the global meteorological operational infrastructure. This is known as the WIS (WMO Information System). The global infrastructure also has aviation, oceanographic, seismic and other users. The WIS includes a global, federated, synchronized, geospatial catalogue, envisaged to encompass all hydro-meteorological data and services. Currently several nodes are operational, cataloguing mainly routinely exchanged observations and forecasts.</p>
        <p>Envisage an environmental scientist in Cambodia, researching the impact of deforestation in Vietnam as part of investigating the regional impacts of climate change. She submits her search keywords, in Cambodian, and receives responses indicating there is some data from the 1950s, printed in a 1960 pamphlet, in the Bibliothèque Nationale, a library in Paris, France, in French. She receives an abstract of some form that enables her to decide that the data are worth accessing, and initiates a request for a digital copy to be sent.</p>
        <p>She receives the pamphlet as a scanned image of each page, and she decides that the quantatitive information in the paper is useful, so she arranges transcription of the tabular numerical data and their summary values into a digital form and publishes the dataset, with a persistent identifier, and links it to a detailed coverage extent, the original paper source, the scanned pages and her paper when it is published. She also incorporates scanned charts and graphs from the orginal pamphlet into her paper.Her organisation creates a catalogue record for her research paper dataset and publishes it in the WIS global catalogue, which makes it also visible to the GEO System of Systems broker portal.</p>

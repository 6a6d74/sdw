      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The mission of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2015/spatial/">Spatial Data on the Web Working Group</a>, as described in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2015/spatial/charter">charter</a>, is to clarify and to formalize standards on spatial data on the web. In particular:
        <ol>
        <li>to determine how spatial information can best be integrated with other data on the Web;</li>
        <li>to determine how machines and people can discover that different facts in different datasets relate to the same place, especially when 'place' is expressed in different ways and at different levels of granularity;</li>
        <li>to identify and assess existing methods and tools and then create a set of best practices for their use;</li>
        <li>where desirable, to complete the standardization of informal technologies already in widespread use.</li>
        </ol>
        This document describes the results of the first steps of working towards these goals. Members of the working group and other stakeholders have come up with a number of <a href="#UseCases">use cases</a> that describe how spatial data on the web could work. From these use cases, a number of <a href="#Requirements">requirements</a> for further work are derived. In this document, use cases, requirements and their relationships are described. Requirements and use cases are also related to the <a href="#Deliverables">deliverables</a> of the working group.
      </p>

    <section id="Deliverables">
      <h2>Deliverables</h2>
      <p>
      The deliverables of this Working Group are described in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2015/spatial/charter">Working Group Charter</a>. For convenience, and to have URIs, those deliverables are replicated in this chapter. The charter remains the authorative source of the definition of deliverables.

      <section id="UseCasesAndRequirements">
        <h3>Use Cases and Requirements</h3>
        <p>A document setting out the range of problems that the working groups are trying to solve (this document).</p>
      </section>
      <section id="BestPractices">
        <h3>Spatial Data on the Web Best Practices</h3>
        <p>This will include:
        <ul>
        <li>an agreed spatial ontology conformant to the ISO 19107 abstract model and based on existing available ontologies such as GeoSPARQL, NeoGeo and the ISA Core Location vocabulary;</li>
        <li>advice on use of URIs as identifiers in GI systems;</li>
        <li>advice on providing different levels of metadata for different usage scenarios (from broad sweep metadata to metadata about individual coordinates in a polygon);</li>
        <li>develop advice on, or possibly define, RESTful APIs to return data in a variety of formats including those defined elsewhere, such as GeoJSON, GeoJSON-LD and TopoJSON.</li>
        </ul>

      <section id="TimeOntologyInOWL">
        <h3>Time Ontology in OWL</h3>
        <p>The WG will work with the authors of the existing Time Ontology in OWL to complete the development of this widely used ontology through to Recommendation status. Further requirements already identified in the geospatial community will be taken into account.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="SemanticSensorNetworkVocabulary">
        <h3>Semantic Sensor Network Vocabulary</h3>
        <p>The WG will work with the members of the former Semantic Sensor Network Incubator Group to develop its ontology into a formal Recommendation, noting the work to split the ontology into smaller sections to offer simplified access.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="CoverageInLinkedData">
        <h3>Coverage in Linked Data</h3>
        <p>The WG will develop a formal Recommendation for expressing discrete coverage data conformant to the ISO 19123 abstract model. Existing standard and de facto ontologies will be examined for applicability; these will include the RDF Data Cube. The Recommendation will include provision for describing the subset of coverages that are simple timeseries datasets - where a time-varying property is measured at a fixed location. OGC's WaterML 2 Part 1 - Timeseries will be used as an initial basis.</p>
        <p>Given that coverage data can often be extremely large in size, publication of the individual data points as Linked Data may not always be appropriate. The Recommendation will include provision for describing an entire coverage dataset and subsets thereof published in more compact formats using Linked Data. For example where a third party wishes to annotate a subset of a large coverage dataset or a data provider wishes to publish a large coverage dataset in smaller subsets to support convenient reuse.</p>

    <section id="UseCases">
      <h2>Use Cases</h2>
        <p>Use cases that describe current problems or future opportunities for spatial data on the web have been gathered as a first activity of the Working Group. Use cases were mainly contributed by members of Working Group, but there were also contributions from other interested parties. In this chapter the use cases are listed and identified. Each use case is related to one or more Working Group <a href="#Deliverables">deliverables</a>. The use cases were analyzed by the Working Group, which led to a set of <a href="#Requirements">requirements</a> for future deliverables. For each use case related requirements are also listed.</p>

          <p>This is really one of several future, but realistic, meteorological scenarios to aim at.</p>
          <p>National Hydro-Meteorological Services around the world are coordinated via the WMO (World Meteorological Organisation), part of the the United Nations system. WMO has the same status as ISO, and its standards and regulatory materials applies to all its 193 national meteorological services and are available in the six working languages ( عربي | 中文 | Fr | Ru | Es | En). WMO has embarked on a long-term (think a decade or so) programme to update the global meteorological operational infrastructure. This is known as the WIS (WMO Information System). The global infrastructure also has aviation, oceanographic, seismic and other users. The WIS includes a global, federated, synchronized, geospatial catalogue, envisaged to encompass all hydro-meteorological data and services. Currently several nodes are operational, cataloguing mainly routinely exchanged observations and forecasts.</p>
          <p>Envisage an environmental scientist in Cambodia, researching the impact of deforestation in Vietnam as part of investigating the regional impacts of climate change. She submits her search keywords, in Cambodian, and receives responses indicating there is some data from the 1950s, printed in a 1960 pamphlet, in the Bibliothèque Nationale, a library in Paris, France, in French. She receives an abstract of some form that enables her to decide that the data are worth accessing, and initiates a request for a digital copy to be sent.</p>
          <p>She receives the pamphlet as a scanned image of each page, and she decides that the quantatitive information in the paper is useful, so she arranges transcription of the tabular numerical data and their summary values into a digital form and publishes the dataset, with a persistent identifier, and links it to a detailed coverage extent, the original paper source, the scanned pages and her paper when it is published. She also incorporates scanned charts and graphs from the orginal pamphlet into her paper.Her organisation creates a catalogue record for her research paper dataset and publishes it in the WIS global catalogue, which makes it also visible to the GEO System of Systems broker portal.</p>

          <h3>Habitat zone verification for designation of Marine Conservation Zones</h3>
          <p class="contributor">Jeremy Tandy</p>
          <label class="expand" for="uc2"></label>
          <input id="uc2" type="checkbox">
          <div>
          <p>The <a href="http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/page-5230">Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009</a> allows for the creation of a type of Marine Protected Area (MPA), called a Marine Conservation Zone (MCZ). MCZs protect a range of nationally important marine wildlife, habitats, geology and geomorphology and can be designated anywhere in English and Welsh inshore and UK offshore waters.</p>
          <p>The designation of a MCZ is dependent on a detailed analysis of the marine environment which results in the definition of geometric areas where a given habitat type is deemed to occur and is published as a habitat map.</p>
          <p>Being a policy statement, it is important to be able to express the provenance of information that was used to compile the habitat map. Moreover, because the marine environment is always changing, it is important to express the time at which this information was collected.</p>
          <p>The information includes:
          <ul>
            <li>acoustic survey</li>
            <li>video (from a video camera towed behind a boat)</li>
            <li>biota observations (based on what is observed in the video and physical collection)</li>
            <li>particle size (sand/mud)</li>
            <li>water column data</li>
            <li>seabed character map: discrete seabed features & backscatter information (from sonar) to determine bottom type</li>
          </ul>
          These information types are varied in type and size. In particular, the acoustic survey (e.g. side-scan sonar) is difficult to manage as these survey results can be many gigabytes in size and cover large areas. A way is needed to refer to just a small part of these coverage data sets that are relevant to a particular habitat zone analysis.

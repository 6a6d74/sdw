      <p><strong>For OGC</strong>This is a Public Draft of a document prepared by the Spatial Data on the Web Working Group (<a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/sdwwg">SDWWG</a>) &mdash; a joint W3C-OGC project (see <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/spatial/charter">charter</a>).

	<h2>Modularisation</h2>
      <p> This section explains the rationale and method for modularisation, together with a 'map' of the modules developed.
	  For now, the SSN-XG structure diagram is included (attribute to Laurent Lefort and Raul Garcia-Castro)

		<p>The modules contain the classes and properties that can be used
		to represent particular aspects of a sensor or its observations:
		for example, sensors, observations, features of interest, the
		process of sensing (i.e. how a sensor operates and observes), how
		sensors are deployed or attached to platforms, the measuring
		capabilities of sensors, as well as their environmental, and
		survival properties of sensors in particular environments.</p>

	<h2>Work Plan</h2>
      <p>This section identifies work that is planned to be done in the next iteration of the document. Comment on these topics and their priority is invited.
	  </p>
	  <ol> 
    <li>   Check and reconsider/redesign modularisation of SSN into patterns by
	<ol>
      <li>   Clearly separate observation, sensor, and deployment parts.
      <li>   Disentangle SSN from DUL (this may require adding things to SSN that are needed from DUL)
      <li>   Reconsider O&M alignment (see O&Mlite) - as alternative to DUL?
      <li>   Provide deeper OWL axiomatization (now that DUL is gone) - kjanowicz to explain
      <li>   See proposal in charter: noting the work to split the ontology into smaller sections to offer simplified access
	</ol>
    <li>   Align with Prov-o
   <li>    Align with rdf datacube 
   <li>  Align with the ontology developed for the coverage deliverable
    <li>  Extend to cover UCRs and/or wish list items and/or these things <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/spatial/wiki/Working_Use_Cases#Various_Sensor_Use_Cases_.28SSN.29"> https://www.w3.org/2015/spatial/wiki/Working_Use_Cases#Various_Sensor_Use_Cases_.28SSN.29 </a> (Action-25)

</li>
<li> The user should be able to understand the network resource cost of proposed instructions (for example, power required per measurement, current battery life, latency before instruction can be executed). These qualities could be interpreted by the scientist user directly, or by an automated agent aiming to optimise network efficiency through resource scheduling and optimisation algorithms.
</li>
       <ol>
	   <li>What goes in SSN and what should be a recommended profile/extract/extension (use kjanowicz's analysis of literature)?
       <li> Develop targeted versions/profiles/extracts/extensions (e.g. Wot? Iot-lite? satelite sensors? samples? human sensors? advise how to do this?
       <li> Re-consider actuation with WoT or Iot-lite
	</ol>
    <li> Revisit annotation properties, including multilingual. Fix typos and spelling
    <li>Transfer/link/align common issues with BP and UCR deliverables.
